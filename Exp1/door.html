	<p>The signature feature of every Koenigsegg from the very first CC8S in 2002, namely the wonderfully overwrought-sounding ‘dihedral synchro-helix actuation system’ that opens the doors. Now it’s probably true that any super-, hyper- or indeed, in the case of the One:1, ‘megacar’ that wants to adhere to a truly ‘exotic’ blueprint has to have doors that ascend skywards rather than opening outwards.</p>
	<p>Simply having doors that floated upwards on gas struts wasn’t theatrical enough for CvK, though, and, more importantly, he felt that conventional scissor doors were both impractical (sailing way above the roofline of the car) and could make climbing in somewhat awkward. What he wanted was ‘minimal swing’ together with a more spacious opening.</p>
