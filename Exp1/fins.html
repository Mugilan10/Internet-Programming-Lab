	<p>
		Most obvious when looking at the Jesko Absolut, is the removed massive rear wing. <br>The wing is removed to reduce downforce and drag â€“ dropping downforce from 1400 kg to 150 kg.<br>

		The Jesko Absolut shape was reassessed with minimal drag in mind. This meant elongating the car, giving it a more tear-dropped shape. <br>The rear extension of the Jesko Absolut makes it 85 mm longer than the track-focused Jesko and the dished rear wheels, really change its appearance.
